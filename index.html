      <p>Are you thinking about what to do next? Are you looking for a new line of work? What brought you to a website for getting suggestions about learning how to program?</p>

          <h3>Would you even like coding?</h3>
          <p>Sometimes your day-to-day habits might give you a clue as to whether you might be a good fit for programming work. Tell us if these habits/proclivities sound like you.</p>
          <p>What do you do in your down time? What do you read? What kind of games do you play?</p>

          <h3>What kinds of things already interest you?</h3>
          <p>It's often a good idea to make choices based the things you already gravitate toward. Having work that matches what you tend to do when you're not at work can make work not work. Or at least make it easier to get through those days, weeks, maybe months (dear god, please not years!) when work is work.</p>
