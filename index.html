      <h1>Epicodus Language/Framework Track Guide</h1>
      <p>Are you thinking about what to do next? Are you looking for a new line of work? What brought you to a website for getting suggestions about learning how to program?</p>

      <p>This site may help you think about what you want and narrow down the unbelievable number of options there are. Take this short-ish survey and we'll give you some opportunities to explore further.</p>

      <div class="" id="habits">
        <h3>Would you even like coding?</h3>
        <p>Sometimes your day-to-day habits might give you a clue as to whether you might be a good fit for programming work. Tell us if these habits/proclivities sound like you (check all that apply):</p>


        <!-- USER HABITS:
        - fastidious
        - focused
        - can't keep your mind on anything for very long
        - see problems as fun to fix
        - enjoy technical discussions & details
        - staying in one spot for extended periods is a bore no matter what you're doing

      <div class="" id="interests">
        <h3>What kinds of things already interest you?</h3>
        <p>It's often a good idea to make choices based the things you already gravitate toward. Having work that matches what you tend to do when you're not at work can make work not work. Or at least make it easier to get through those days, weeks, maybe months (dear god, please not years!) when work is work.</p>

        <p>What do you do in your down time? What do you read? What kind of games do you play?</p>
        <!-- USER INTERESTS:
        - magazines
        - blogs
        - books
        - games

        <h3>What are you looking for in a career?</h3>
        <p>So it looks like coding may be a good option for you to explore. Now we can start to winnow down the choices for you.</p>

        <p>Sometime the place you envision yourself working can give you some hints as to which langauge/framework to choose. When you day dream about your future work where do you see yourself?</p>

        <!-- USER GOALS:
        What kind of businesses do you think you might want to work for?
